## Description

An Embedded System that can detect glass breaking sound which trigger camera recording and send notification alert.

This project was inspired by my living situation inside of a fenced community. Inside is relatively safe, but due to crowding, many are forced to park on the street outside the fence. With some regularity, car burglars will break into these cars at night and steal items. Thus this projectâ€™s goal and ultimate requirement is to either catch them in the act and lead to their arrests or, more optimally, dissuade them from stealing. It would provide more security and peace of mind to the residents and perhaps increase property values.

## Requirements

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Control servo motors to the desinated position
* [x] Record video and save to local folder with Date naming
* [x] Sampling analog signal from sound sensor

The following **future improvement** features are implemented:

* [ ] Sampling from three separate microphone in parallel
* [ ] Detect glass-breaking sound
* [ ] Move camera to the position where the glass-breaking event occurs and record a video from it
* [ ] Send alert through SMS

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Create UI Web server that can see live streaming and control from device.
